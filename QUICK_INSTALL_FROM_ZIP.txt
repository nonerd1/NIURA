QUICK INSTALL GUIDE - From Zipped Project to iPhone
===================================================

PREREQUISITES:
- Mac with Xcode already installed
- iPhone with USB cable
- Node.js installed (if not: download from nodejs.org)

STEP-BY-STEP INSTALLATION:
=========================

1. EXTRACT PROJECT
   - Unzip the NIURA project file
   - Navigate to the extracted folder in Terminal:
     cd /path/to/NIURA

2. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
   - Install Node.js packages:
     npm install
   
   - Install iOS dependencies:
     cd ios
     pod install
     cd ..

3. OPEN IN XCODE
   - Open the iOS workspace (NOT the .xcodeproj file):
     open ios/NIURA.xcworkspace
   
   - Wait for Xcode to finish indexing (this takes a few minutes)

4. PREPARE YOUR IPHONE
   - Connect iPhone to Mac via USB cable
   - Unlock your iPhone
   - If prompted, tap "Trust This Computer" on iPhone
   - In Xcode, select your iPhone from the device dropdown (top-left)

5. BUILD AND INSTALL
   - In Xcode, click the Play button (▶) or press Cmd+R
   - Xcode will build and install the app on your iPhone
   - First build takes 5-15 minutes (subsequent builds are faster)

6. TRUST DEVELOPER CERTIFICATE (If Required)
   - If app doesn't open, go to iPhone Settings
   - Navigate to: General > VPN & Device Management
   - Find the developer profile and tap "Trust"

7. START DEVELOPMENT SERVER (For Live Updates)
   - In Terminal, run:
     npx expo start --dev-client
   
   - The app on your iPhone will connect automatically
   - Now any code changes will appear instantly on your phone

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============

BUILD ERRORS:
- Clean build folder: Product > Clean Build Folder in Xcode
- Try: rm -rf node_modules && npm install
- Try: cd ios && pod install --repo-update && cd ..

DEVICE NOT SHOWING:
- Ensure iPhone is unlocked and trusted
- Try unplugging and reconnecting USB cable
- Restart Xcode

APP WON'T OPEN:
- Check iPhone Settings > General > VPN & Device Management
- Trust the developer certificate

METRO/EXPO ERRORS:
- Clear cache: npx expo start --dev-client --clear
- Restart Metro: kill any running expo processes and restart

EXPECTED RESULT:
===============
✅ NIURA app installed as native app on iPhone
✅ All features working (Bluetooth, navigation, etc.)
✅ Hot reloading for instant code updates
✅ Ready for development and testing

TOTAL TIME: 15-30 minutes (mostly waiting for builds)

WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
- HomeScreen with focus/stress metrics
- Real-time speedometer gauges
- Bluetooth connection interface
- All navigation working between screens
