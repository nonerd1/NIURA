Fixing Metro Bundler EMFILE Error

The error you're seeing is:
"Error: EMFILE: too many open files, watch"

This is a common issue with Node.js/Metro file watching on macOS. Here's how to fix it:

1. First, kill any existing Metro processes:
```bash
pkill -f "node|expo|metro"
```

2. Increase the system's file watch limit. Add these lines to your ~/.zshrc file:
```bash
echo "ulimit -n 10240" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

3. For immediate effect without restarting, run:
```bash
ulimit -n 10240
```

4. Install watchman (recommended by Metro for better file watching):
```bash
brew install watchman
```

5. Clear Metro bundler cache:
```bash
cd RyanApp
npm start -- --reset-cache
```

6. If using Expo, clear its cache too:
```bash
expo start -c
```

If the error persists:

1. Try running with the --max-old-space-size flag:
```bash
node --max-old-space-size=4096 node_modules/expo/bin/cli.js start
```

2. Check system file limits:
```bash
launchctl limit maxfiles
```

3. If needed, set system-wide limits by creating/editing /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>limit.maxfiles</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
      <string>launchctl</string>
      <string>limit</string>
      <string>maxfiles</string>
      <string>10240</string>
      <string>10240</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>ServiceIPC</key>
    <false/>
  </dict>
</plist>
```

Steps to implement:

1. First try the quick fix:
```bash
ulimit -n 10240
pkill -f "node|expo|metro"
niura wake up
```

2. If that doesn't work, install watchman:
```bash
brew install watchman
niura wake up
```

3. If still seeing issues, clear caches:
```bash
npm start -- --reset-cache
expo start -c
```

Common Issues:
1. System file limit too low
2. Too many Metro/Node processes running
3. Corrupted Metro cache
4. Missing watchman
5. System resources constrained

Remember:
- The ulimit change is temporary unless added to ~/.zshrc
- Watchman is recommended for better performance
- Clearing cache can help resolve watching issues
- System limits may need admin privileges to change

Additional Tips:
1. Use Activity Monitor to check for stuck Node processes
2. Consider using VSCode's integrated terminal
3. Make sure you have enough free system resources
4. Check disk space availability

After implementing these changes, the Metro bundler should start without the EMFILE error.
