Network Configuration Instructions for Ryan's Laptop Server

Context:
- The FastAPI backend server needs to be accessible to:
  1. Ishaan's phone (for initial testing)
  2. Ryan's phone (for final deployment)
- Both phones will be connecting to the same ESP32 device via BLE
- The server needs to handle data from both devices

Required Network Setup:

1. Server Configuration:
   - Run the FastAPI server on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0)
   - Use a consistent port (e.g., 8000)
   - Enable CORS to allow connections from both phones
   - Set up proper error handling for network issues

2. Network Access:
   - Ensure the server is accessible on the local network
   - Document the laptop's local IP address
   - Test connectivity from both phones
   - Set up proper firewall rules if needed

3. CORS Configuration:
   - Allow requests from both phone's IP addresses
   - Configure CORS middleware in FastAPI
   - Allow necessary HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)
   - Set appropriate headers for mobile access

4. Testing Steps:
   - Test server accessibility from Ishaan's phone first
   - Verify data flow from phone to server
   - Test with Ryan's phone when available
   - Document any network issues or solutions

5. Security Considerations:
   - Keep the server on the local network for now
   - Document any security measures implemented
   - Note any credentials or access tokens needed
   - Plan for future security enhancements

Important Notes:
- The server must be running when either phone is using the app
- Both phones will connect to the same ESP32 device
- Data from both phones should be properly separated in the database
- Network configuration should be documented for future reference

Start by:
1. Checking the laptop's network configuration
2. Setting up the server with proper CORS
3. Testing connectivity from Ishaan's phone
4. Documenting the setup for Ryan's phone

Remember:
- Keep track of IP addresses and ports used
- Document any network-specific configurations
- Test connectivity regularly
- Plan for future network changes or deployments

The goal is to have a server that:
1. Is accessible to both phones
2. Handles data from both devices properly
3. Maintains data separation between users
4. Provides reliable connectivity
5. Can be easily configured for future changes

Begin by checking the current network setup and proceed with the configuration steps.
