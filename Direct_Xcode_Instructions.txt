Skip the QR Code - Direct Xcode Launch Instructions

Let's forget about the QR code and Expo Go completely. Instead, we'll run the app directly through Xcode:

1. Kill all existing processes first:
```bash
pkill -f "node|expo|metro"
```

2. Make sure you're in the RyanApp directory:
```bash
cd RyanApp
```

3. Open the Xcode workspace:
```bash
open ios/RyanApp.xcworkspace
```

4. In Xcode:
   - Select your iPhone as the target device at the top
   - Click the Play (▶️) button to build and run
   - If asked, trust the developer certificate

That's it. The app should install and run directly on your phone.

If Xcode asks to trust developer:
1. On your iPhone: Settings → General → VPN & Device Management
2. Trust the developer certificate

No QR codes, no Expo Go, no tunneling needed. Just direct installation through Xcode.
