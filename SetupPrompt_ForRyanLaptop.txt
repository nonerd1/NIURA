Setup Instructions for Ryan's Laptop Environment

Context:
- The NIURA app is already set up and will be installed on Ryan's phone using Ishaan's laptop
- Ryan's laptop needs to host all backend services and servers
- The app connects to an ESP32 device for focus/stress measurements via BLE
- Authentication has been bypassed for immediate access

Required Setup Components:

1. FastAPI Backend Server:
   - Needs to be running locally on Ryan's laptop
   - Handles data processing and storage
   - Will receive focus/stress measurements from the app
   - Endpoints for metrics, insights, and data analysis

2. Database Setup:
   - PostgreSQL database for storing:
     * Focus/stress measurements
     * Session data
     * Analytics and insights
   - Need to create necessary tables and schemas

3. Environment Requirements:
   - Python 3.8 or higher
   - Node.js and npm
   - PostgreSQL
   - Required Python packages for data processing

4. AWS Configuration:
   - AWS Cognito is configured but currently bypassed
   - Keep the existing configuration:
     * User Pool ID: us-east-2_wzLPL1i6B
     * Client ID: 2j3rbovc4b5lh0h9kdeordp1cb
     * Region: us-east-2

Steps for You (Cursor AI) to Help Set Up:

1. First Steps:
   - Check Python installation
   - Set up PostgreSQL
   - Install required packages
   - Create necessary directories

2. Backend Setup:
   - Clone/set up the FastAPI backend
   - Configure database connection
   - Set up environment variables
   - Create required database tables

3. Testing:
   - Verify database connectivity
   - Test API endpoints
   - Ensure data storage is working
   - Check metrics calculations

4. Integration:
   - Make sure backend is accessible to the app
   - Configure any necessary network settings
   - Test data flow from app to backend

Important Notes:
- The app is already modified to skip authentication
- Focus on getting the backend and database running
- The app will connect to ESP32 via BLE directly
- Data should flow: App -> Backend -> Database

Start by asking about the current state of Ryan's laptop (OS, installed software, etc.) and then proceed with the setup process step by step.

Remember:
- Keep track of all credentials created
- Document any custom configurations
- Test each component thoroughly
- Ensure proper error handling
- Set up logging for debugging

The goal is to have a fully functional backend environment that can:
1. Receive and store data from the app
2. Process focus/stress measurements
3. Generate insights and analytics
4. Maintain data persistence
5. Handle multiple sessions and users

Begin by confirming the OS and checking for required software before proceeding with the installation steps.
