NIURA App Setup Instructions for Cursor AI

1. Project Structure:
   - This is a React Native Expo app
   - Uses AWS Cognito (but authentication is currently bypassed)
   - Uses BLE for device connectivity
   - Voice commands enabled

2. Important Files Modified:
   - App.tsx: Main app configuration, authentication removed
   - src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx: Navigation setup, login screens removed
   - src/types/navigation.ts: Navigation types
   - src/services/auth.ts: Authentication service (currently bypassed)

3. Steps to Set Up:
   a) First, install dependencies:
      ```
      npm install --legacy-peer-deps
      ```
   
   b) Make sure these packages are installed:
      - aws-amplify
      - @aws-amplify/ui-react-native
      - amazon-cognito-identity-js
      - @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
      - @react-native-community/netinfo
      - react-native-get-random-values

   c) The app is configured to skip authentication and go directly to main functionality
   
   d) Voice command "Niura wake up" should work immediately

4. AWS Configuration:
   - AWS Cognito is configured but bypassed
   - User Pool ID: us-east-2_wzLPL1i6B
   - Client ID: 2j3rbovc4b5lh0h9kdeordp1cb
   - Region: us-east-2

5. Running the App:
   - For iOS: Use Xcode to build and run
   - Make sure to have Xcode and iOS development environment set up
   - The app should start directly at the main tabs
   - No login required

6. Known Working State:
   - Authentication is bypassed
   - Voice commands work
   - BLE connectivity works
   - All main features accessible

7. Important Notes:
   - Do not enable authentication without proper testing
   - Keep the current navigation setup that skips login
   - The app is configured for immediate use without any login requirements

8. If Changes Needed:
   - Main navigation is in AppNavigator.tsx
   - Authentication logic (currently bypassed) is in auth.ts
   - Voice command setup remains unchanged

For any issues or questions, refer to the original conversation in Cursor AI where we disabled authentication and set up direct access.
