Fixing "No Usable Data Found" QR Code Error

The error you're seeing when scanning the QR code typically occurs when:
1. The Metro bundler isn't properly serving the development build
2. The QR code isn't being generated correctly
3. Network connectivity issues between your laptop and phone

Let's fix this step by step:

1. First, ensure you're on the same network:
   - Connect both your laptop and phone to the same WiFi network
   - Avoid using different networks or VPNs

2. Clear Expo's cache and restart with tunnel mode:
```bash
# Kill existing processes
pkill -f "node|expo|metro"

# Clear Expo cache and start in tunnel mode
cd RyanApp
expo start -c --tunnel
```

3. If the QR code still isn't working, try these alternatives:
   a) Use the 'w' key to open in web browser first
   b) Use the 'i' key to open in iOS simulator
   c) Copy the exp:// URL manually into the Expo Go app

4. Check your app.json configuration:
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "RyanApp",
    "slug": "RyanApp",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "scheme": "ryanapp",
    "platforms": ["ios", "android"],
    "orientation": "portrait"
  }
}
```

5. Try explicit host configuration:
```bash
# Get your IP address
ipconfig getifaddr en0

# Start with explicit host
expo start --tunnel --host <your-ip-address>
```

6. If using a development build, rebuild it:
```bash
expo prebuild --clean
expo run:ios
```

Troubleshooting Steps:

1. Network Connectivity:
   - Ensure both devices are on same network
   - Try disabling firewall temporarily
   - Check if port 19000 is accessible

2. Expo Go App:
   - Force close and reopen Expo Go
   - Check if Expo Go is updated
   - Try scanning with phone's camera app instead

3. Development Environment:
   - Make sure you're in the correct directory
   - Verify Metro bundler is running
   - Check terminal for any error messages

4. If nothing else works:
   ```bash
   # Full reset sequence
   1. pkill -f "node|expo|metro"
   2. rm -rf node_modules
   3. rm -rf .expo
   4. npm install
   5. expo start -c --tunnel
   ```

Common Issues:
1. Network connectivity problems
2. Outdated Expo Go app
3. Cache issues
4. Wrong development environment
5. Port conflicts

Remember:
- Always use tunnel mode when developing
- Keep Expo Go app updated
- Check network connectivity
- Monitor terminal for errors

Additional Tips:
1. Try using a different QR code scanner app
2. Verify the exp:// URL format is correct
3. Check if development server is reachable
4. Monitor system resources

After implementing these changes, you should be able to scan the QR code successfully. If issues persist, try connecting your iPhone via USB and using Xcode to run the app directly.
